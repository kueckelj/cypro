  'Interval' and 'Interval Unit' refer to the timelapse between these images beeing made. If the track files you read in contain data that exceed the number of images specified 
  here the files will be filtered accordingly such that only data up to the 'Total Number of Images' is included.",
  
  experiment_phases = "If you have split your experiment in several phases (e.g. you started imaging with no treatment and after 24 hours you changed the condition of some wells and
  24 hours later you changed the conditions again - while maintaining the imaging process) you can specify the number of phases as well as their respective 
  starting point here. This will affect the way you can design the well plates (Step 4) which is why this step has to be done previously to that. Changing
  the experiment phases set up will result in all well plates saved up to that point beeing lost.",

  of these files will be assigned to the different conditions and experiment phases. Clicking on 'New Well Plate' will create an empty well plate visualized on the right.
  'Covered Areas per Well' refers to the number of images made per well per imaging interval. The area's number is denoted as the last number of the respective file name
  (e.g. ~/A1_1.csv, ~/A1_2.csv, ~/A1_3.csv would require you to set 'Covered Areas per Well' to 3).
  Once the well plate is visualized you can interactively select wells which highlights them in dark red. Continue with specifiying their cell line and their conditions via the respective text inputs.
  After clicking on 'Add Info' you will see a small info box in the right lower corner telling you whether saving the information was successfull or not. If successfull click on the well plate plot again 
  and you should see that the color of the wells have changed. 
  
  Before continuing with the next well plate make sure to add the well plate via 'Add Well Plate'. Not doing that before continuing with 'New Well Plate' results in all specifications beeing lost. Info boxes

  as current x- and y-coordinate, shape diameter, illuminance intensitry etc.). Each row must be uniquely identified by a column providing the cell's ID and a column providing the image number the row bases on.
  These two columns have to be specified. If you want cypro to analyze migration data you have to denote the columns refering to the cell's x- and y-coordinates as well. If your files do not contain these columns you can
  leave them out which will result in a cypro object that is incompatible with cypro functions dealing with migration data.",

  This includes the 'Distance from last point (dflp)', 'Distance from origin (dfo)' and the 'Speed (speed)'. As cypro automatically calculates these three variables there is no need to make cypro keep them additionally if your 
  example file already contains them. If your example files  contains columns referring to the cells morphology at a given image like 'Cell Diameter', 'Number of Connections' etc. you can denote them here. Eventually,
  while loading all files your experiment contains via loadData() cypro will read in all files and keep the columns you've denoted in Step 2 and 3. The function processData() will summarize the tracking data columns via statistical
  measures like minimum, maximum, mean, median which you can compare later on across cell lines, conditions, clustering results etc. (e.g. 'Cell Diameter' of the track files will be summarized to 'mean_cell_diameter', 'min_cell_diamter' etc.

  opens a window that gives you access to the folders of your device. Select the one that contains the files of the respective well plate or that again contains (sub-)folders in which the files are stored.
  (If you want cypro to look in subfolders, too, make sure that 'Include Subfolders' is enabled.) After you have assigned the folder by closing the window you will see a well plate plot appear right above the 
  button 'Assign Folder: Browse'. The wells will be colored according to the number of files that have been found in the folder you specified. Green/Complete means that all files have been found. 
  Yellow/Incomplete means that some files of the well have been found. (e.g. you set 'Covered Areas per Well' to 3 which made cypro expect files 'A1_1.csv', 'A1_2.csv' and 'A1_3.csv'.
  However only 'A1_1.csv' and 'A1_3.csv' have been found). Missing/Red means that no files of that well have been found at all. Blue/Ambiguous might appear if you stored the files in 
  subfolders of the assigned folder and some folders contain files with equal names due to typos while naming the files. (e.g. ~/Ctrl/A1_1.csv, ~/Treatment/A1_1.csv) If you realized that you assigned the wrong folder

  wells do not prevent you from reading in all other files found - no need to design the experiment again if you realize that some files are missing. Just click on 'Load Data' and the missing files will be ignored. In case of ambiguous
  wells you need to rename or delete the files that are doubled before loading the data.",

  reading the files. In case of no errors you can simply click on 'Save & Proceed' and afterwards on 'Return cypro Object'. If the box hints at errors occured you can try and fix the cause for these errors and then click on 'Load Data' again
