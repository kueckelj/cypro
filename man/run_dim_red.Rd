  object,
  variable_set,
  phase = NULL,
  method_dim_red = "pca",
  force = FALSE,
  verbose = NULL,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{A valid cypro object.}

\item{variable_set}{Character value. Denotes the variable set of interest. Use \code{getVariableSetNames()}
to obtain all names of currently stored variable sets in your object.}

\item{phase}{Character value. The ordinal value referring to the phase of interest (e.g. \emph{'first'}, \emph{'second'} etc.).
referring to the phase of interest. If set to NULL takes the phase denoted as default with \code{adjustDefault()}.

Ignored if the experiment design contains only one phase.}

\item{force}{Logical value. Needs to be set to TRUE if you want to overwrite an already existing
set up or already existing results.}

\item{verbose}{Logical. If set to TRUE informative messages regarding
the computational progress will be printed.
