\usage{

  wp_list,
  recursive = TRUE,
  keep_filetype = "csv$"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{wp_list}{A list that contains a well-plate data.frame and a directory leading to the folder in which
the respective files are stored.}

\item{recursive}{Logical value. Given to argument \code{recursive} of \code{base::list.files()}.}

\item{keep_filetype}{Character value. Determines the filetype to be ignored if for one well-image
a .csv and a .xls file is found. Either \emph{'xls$'} or \emph{'csv$'}.}
}
\value{
The same list with additional slots containing a the well-plate data.frame joined

\description{
This functions takes a list as input that contains a well-plate data.frame (slot
must be named \emph{wp_df}) and a directory. The directory leads to the folder in which to look for
.csv and .xls files named according to the well-image they belong. The availability of files is compared
to what is expected based on the well-plate data.frame (wells, number of images per well etc.)
