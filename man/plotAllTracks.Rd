\arguments{
\item{object}{A valid cypro object.}

\item{across}{Character value or NULL. Specifies the grouping variable of interest.

Use \code{getGroupingOptions()} to obtain all variable names that group the
cells of your experiment in a certain manner.}

\item{across_subset}{Character vector or NULL. Specifies the particular groups
of interest the grouping variable specified in argument \code{across} contains.

If set to NULL all of them are chosen. You can prefix groups you are NOT interested in
with a \emph{'-'}. (Saves writing if there are more groups you are interested in
than groups you are not interested in.)

Use \code{getGroupNames()} to obtain all valid input options.}

\item{phase}{Character value. The ordinal value referring to the phase of interest (e.g. \emph{'first'}, \emph{'second'} etc.).
referring to the phase of interest. If set to NULL takes the phase denoted as default with \code{adjustDefault()}.

Ignored if the experiment design contains only one phase.}

\item{n_cells}{Numeric calue. Determines the number of cells that are randomly chosen from
every group to be displayed. Useful to keep plots insightful and aesthetically pleasing.}

\item{linetype}{Character value. Valid options are \emph{'solid', 'twodash', 'longdash', 'dotted'}
and \emph{'dotdash'}.}

\item{linesize}{Numeric value. Denotes the size of the lines drawn.}

\item{clrp}{Character value. Specifies the color palette to be used to represent
groups of discrete variables. Run \code{validColorPalettes()} to obtain valid
input options.}

\item{verbose}{Logical. If set to TRUE informative messages regarding
the computational progress will be printed.

(Warning messages will always be printed.)}

\value{
A ggplot.

\description{
Visualizes the cells migration in a typical migration plot.
Scales the cell's x- and y-coordinates such that all cell's migration
paths start from the same position.
